https://github.com/bph-tuwien/ConcreteMixingSimulator/releases
2. Extract the archive to a desired folder. The password can be found next to the given archive's link on the release page.
3. Start the game by running the `ConcreteMixing.exe` or on Mac the `ConcreteMixing.app`.

## How to Play

 * You can move around with the WASD keys and turn by moving the mouse.
 * An object can be picked up by pointing the red crosshair to it and clicking the right mouse button while being relativel close to the object.
 * While holding the object you can still move and turn, and by scrolling with the mouse wheel the picked up object can be moved further or closer to you.
 * You can drop an object by clicking the right mouse button.
 * You can use an object by aiming with the crosshair for another (target) object and clicking the left mouse button while holding the object. For example, pick up the spoon and aim for a labeled ingredient jar (except oil) to take ingredient out of the jar. Some objects don't require another object to be used. 
 * The game can be restarted by pressing the R key, and excited by pressing the Escape key.
